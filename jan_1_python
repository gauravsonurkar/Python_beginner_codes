# x = x + 10 



# the pass statement 

# pass is a null operation. Nothing happens when it executes. It is useful as a 
# placeholder when the statement is required syntactically, but no code needs to be 
# excecuted

#     pass


# The del statement

#The Python del is use to delete objects / variables.

# syntax
# del target_list


# x = 10 
# y = 30

# print(x,y)

# del x,y

# print(x,y)


# The return statement 

# we create a function in python to perform a specific task, the function can return a value 
# that is nothing but an output of function excecution 

# using a return function we can return value from a function when called 

# example:

# def addition(num1, num2):
#     return num1 + num2
    
# result = addition (10,20)
# print(result)

# Import function is used for the import the modules / function
# Example:

# import datetime

# now = datetime.datetime.now()
# print(now)
