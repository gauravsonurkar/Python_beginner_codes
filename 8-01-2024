# 1. calculate the multiplication and sum of the two numbers 


# def num_pro(num1, num2):
#     product = num1 * num2
    
#     if product <= 1000:
#         return product
        
#     else:
#         return num1 + num2
        


# result = num_pro(20,30)

# print("The result is ", result)



# 2. print the sum of the current number and the  previous number 

# write a program to iterate the first 10 numbers, and in each iteration , print the sum 
# of the current and previous number 


# print("printing the sum of the current number and the previous number: ")

# previous_num = 0 

# for i in range(1,11):
    
#     x_sum = previous_num + i
#     print("current_num",i,"previous_num",previous_num, "sum:", x_sum )
    
#     previous_num = i
    

#3. print the characters from a string that are present at an even index number 

# str1 = input ("Enter the number")

# print("Printing the even index chars ")

# size = len(str1)

# for i in range(0,size-1,2):
#     print(i, "and", str1[i])




#4 remove first n characters from the string

# def remove_char (word, n):
#     print("Original string ", word)
#     x = word[n:]
#     return x
    
# print("Removing characters from a string ")
# print(remove_char("pynative", 4))
# print(remove_char("pynative", 2))


#5 check if the first and last number of list is the same 

# def numbersyste ( numberlist):
    
#     print("Original list: ", numberlist)
#     first_x = numberlist[0]
#     last_y = numberlist[-1]
    
#     if first_x == last_y:
#         return True
#     else:
#         return False
        
        
# number_x = [10, 20, 30, 40, 10]
# print("result is ", numbersyste(number_x))
# number_y = [75,65,35,75,30]
# print("result is ", numbersyste(number_y))


#6 Exercise 6: Display numbers divisible by 5 from a list

num_list = [10,20,33,46,55]
print("Given list: ", num_list)
print('divisible by 5: ')

for num in num_list:
    if num % 5 == 0:
        print(num)
